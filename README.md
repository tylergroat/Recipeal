# Recipeal
Github Repository for CSC 4996 (Senior Capstone) for development of the Recipeal Project

Recipe finding has become convoluted, and time consuming. The goal of this project, it to present recipes to users in a simple and intuitive way. 

Borrowing from the Tinder formula, we aim to present users with recipes in a modular card format. A picture, and some basic info about the recipe will be displayed to the user on the front side of the card. We will then have additional information, such as the ingredients, and preparation steps on the back side of the card. Users can save these recipes to their account for later use.
