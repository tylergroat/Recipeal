# Recipeal
Github Repository for CSC 4996 (Senior Capstone) for development of the Recipeal Project

Recipe finding has become convoluted, and time consuming. The goal of this project, it to present recipes to users in a simple and intuitive way. Borrowing from the Tinder formula, we aim to present users with recipes in a modular card format, of which they can like or diskike.

This app was developed using Dart and Flutter for a few reasons. One of the main reasons is because Flutter allows for seamless cross-platform development. Having the flexibility to choose your deployment platform proved very useful over the course of our project. Another reason for using this technology, was for the simple fact that it was new technology to each developer working on this project. We wanted to not only build a cool and orignal piece of software, but also the challenge and excitement of learning something new.
